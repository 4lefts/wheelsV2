# Wheels V2

Another go at creating a meditative web app that plays cyclical sine waves. Currently plays a major scale centered around a3 (220hz).

It uses [pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning) to create the scale.

##To Dos
* Add more scales, and a selection input to choose between them. The number of nodes will need to update
* Sort out the panning - at the moment it's just randomised for each node between -1 and 1. The nodes should really be panned according to their positions around the wheel.
